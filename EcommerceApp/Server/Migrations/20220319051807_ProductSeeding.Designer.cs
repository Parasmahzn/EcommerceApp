It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, it centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance and repressive regimentation of people and behaviours within society.[2][3] Orwell, a democratic socialist, modelled the totalitarian government in the novel after Stalinist Russia and Nazi Germany.[2][3][4] More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within politics and the ways in which they are manipulated.",

Among all the author's books, it is also the most widely held in libraries.[2] Although it was originally the first of The Chronicles of Narnia, it is volume two in recent editions that are sequenced by the stories' chronology. Like the other Chronicles, it was illustrated by Pauline Baynes, and her work has been retained in many later editions",
